# Introduction
This project aims to build a system where patients can find for their nearest clinics and make an appointment without directly go to the clinic for registration and wait to be diagnosed. Furthermore, they can make an appointment with the doctor beforehand so that they don't have to wait for their turn.

# Problems
- patients want to search for a clinic that near them. However, patients can be a new residence in an area or they are not familiar with the traffic in that area.
- Sometimes, patients doesn't know how to find clinic that is specified in a field (eye, teeth, bone, etc) 
- Patients are to busy to remember their reassessment day.
